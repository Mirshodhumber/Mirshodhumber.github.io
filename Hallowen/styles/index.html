	<h2>Welcome to my site. Please come in and stay awhile.	</h2>
	<p>
		I started this website because Halloween has always been my favorite holiday. But during the last <br> year, I started selling some of my favorite Halloween products, and they've become quite a hit.
		</p>
		<p>If you click on the Personal link, you can browse my favorite Halloween pictures, stories, and films. <br> And if you join my email list, I will keep you up-to-date on all things Halloween.
